      <p>1. iPhone XR<br><br>


      OFFICIAL PRICE £794.00$1036.00<br>
      LOWEST PRICE £499.00$651.50<br><br>


      Screen The iPhone XR may be the cheapest of Apple's three new iPhones,
      but it sits in the middle of the trio in terms of screen size with its
      6.1-inch display. This provides lots of space for movies and games,
      although its resolution is under full HD.<br><br>

      Camera The camera on the iPhone XR doesn't hit the same heights as its XS
      siblings, and portrait mode is a little lacking, but it still offers up
      the same intuitive Apple interface and an auto mode than makes the best of
      most scenarios.<br><br>

      Battery life The shining light for the iPhone XR is its battery life. If
      you're looking for an iPhone with great endurance, this is it, with the XR
      easily lasting a full day on a single charge<br><br>

      2. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus<br><br>


      OFFICIAL PRICE £549.00//$717.00<br>
      LOWEST PRICE £549.00//$717.00<br><br>

      Screen The Super AMOLED 6.2-inch display has been measured as one of the very
      best around right now, with super colours, great dynamic range and, essentially,
      the very best viewing experience you can have on a mobile phone.<br><br>

      Battery life The battery life on the S9 Plus is better than that seen on the
      smaller S9, thanks to the 3,500mAh battery in the Plus model - although it's
      probably the weakest part of the phone, not offering as much life as people would
      have liked.<br><br>

      Camera The camera on the Galaxy S9 Plus is among the best on the market,
      and the dual-aperture capability offers some good pictures when things
      get a little darker.
      Colours can look washed out when the exposure is higher, but the power of the
      sensor, with memory built into it to make it smarter than most rivals,
      and it offers very low-noise shots.<br><br>

      <p>3. Huawei P20 Pro<br><br>


      OFFICIAL PRICE: £799.00//$1043.00<br>
      LOWEST PRICE: £589.99//$770.00<br><br>

      Screen: The 6.1-inch display is only Full HD, but that does help with battery
      life. This is actually probably one of the weakest parts of the phone, as it
      lacks the colour reproduction of other phones, but it does come with a screen
      protector pre-fitted.<br><br>

      Battery life: The Huawei P20 Pro will get you a day and half of light to
      moderate use - it goes down after a full month's effort, filling it with apps,
      but even still we're getting a good day's hard use, which is great.<br><br>

      Camera: The camera is the standout feature on the Huawei P20 Pro, offering three
      lenses and they're actually useful. The resolution is pin sharp thanks to
      brilliant image stabilisation, the software photo optimisation is excellent and
      the 40MP sensor has been boosted well by Leica for good low light
      performance.<br><br>

      OFFICIAL PRICE: £612.00//$799.00<br>
      LOWEST PRICE: £612.00//$799.00<br><br>

      Screen At 5.5 inches, the screen on the Google Pixel 3 isn't small, but it's
      one of the smallest in this list. The full HD resolution isn't quite as
      sharp as other phones' panel, but it still looks great.<br><br>

      Camera You get the same camera here as you do on the Pixel 3 XL, and that
      is great news as it's one of the best smartphone cameras we've ever tested.
      It's easy to use, extremely powerful and produces excellent shots.<br><br>

      Battery life The Google Pixel 3 battery life isn't as impressive as the
      Pixel 3 XL which has a bigger power pack. It should give you a day of use,
      but don't expect for than that necessarily.<br><br>
